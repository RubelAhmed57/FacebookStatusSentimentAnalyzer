LETS WIN this November - get out and VOTE! **REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY** Thank you. It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey. I’ve come to know and love the people of New Hampshire. You are strong, independent and you are free. We are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House. We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans. We are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American. We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country. We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service. Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors. I am an outsider fighting for you. Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money. The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow the money. The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton. Again, just follow the money. In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds. She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office. The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government. Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State. Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks. She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance, she’d put the Oval Office up for sale too. She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We're going to call them the FBI Immunity 5. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails. She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country. The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens. The Clintons are the sordid past. We are the bright future. While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions. This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough. Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don’t think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she’ll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men “super-predators.” Same thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over. A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people. My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs. Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order. We will unleash the power of American energy – we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people. Common core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice. The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced. And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated. NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton – and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved. You’ve lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal. Hillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership – which would destroy manufacturing in this state. Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America. From now on, it’s going to be America First. Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen? Think about it. For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students? All the things you’ve ever wanted for your country have been denied. The reason for this is simple. It’s because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don’t want these changes to happen. These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. She’s been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She’s there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money. Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we’re taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want. That includes keeping your family safe. New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America’s large cities, and that it’s the largest single-year increase in 45 years. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January. The failed politicians and the arrogant media don’t want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country. They just want me to go along with the status quo. Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us. We will never back down from fighting to save American lives. That also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Hillary Clinton can’t even say the words. We are also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border. The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled – once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people. I am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border – that is a promise. The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We’re trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They’re all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable. I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country. Together, we can accomplish anything we want. But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th. You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help. You have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true. Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away. You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation. The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before. Here is just some of the great things that will happen for your country: We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American steel into the spine of this country. I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans. Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag. It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future. Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. We Will Make America Safe Again. And We Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!", "My condolences to those involved in today's horrible accident in NJ and my deepest gratitude to all of the amazing first responders.", 'The problem with Crooked Hillary\'s appeal? \'It\'s all me, me, me......"', "Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street – BIG TIME! All part of the rigged system being run at YOUR expense. It's time to end the Clinton Corruption and do what is right for the American people! #FollowTheMoney", 'FOLLOW THE MONEY **REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY**  Thank you. It’s so great to be in Wisconsin tonight. A recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll – and a new post-debate Google poll has us leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that’s despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton. On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House. It’s going to be a victory for YOU, the American people. We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service. Hillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself. I am an outsider fighting for you. One of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country. Our good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight. New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America’s large cities, and that it’s the largest single-year increase in 45 years. More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January. Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore. Across the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year. This is a national crisis. Yet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police. First, she calls our supporters – many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters – deplorable and irredeemable. Then, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of “implicit bias,” – essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced. Maybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself. After all, she is the one who described young African-American men as “super-predators.” How can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens? How can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables? By smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President. She has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace. The police officers she attacks are the same people – of all colors and nationalities – who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers. Those fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens. My agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities. We are going to save thousands of lives. The special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don’t want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities. They don’t want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens. They want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache. Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us. I will never back down from fighting to save American lives. I will never back down from fighting to save America’s inner cities. The only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks. Follow The Money. Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don’t think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she’ll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change. Same thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over. 58% of African-American youth don’t have jobs. There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours. 45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty. The inner cities have been left behind. Crime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it’s dangerous to walk down the street with your child. To the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it. I will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before. Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money. The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow The Money. The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow The Money. The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow The Money. The special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton. Follow The Money. She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country. In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds. She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms. She and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office. It’s all part of the rigged system being run at your expense. The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government. Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State. And don’t forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton – or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds. She even gave up 20% of America’s uranium supply to Russia. She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance, she’d put the Oval Office up for sale too. She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails. The American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons’ scandals and corruption. This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough. Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries. I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America. From now on, it’s going to be America First. These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She’s there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money. Look at her career. She’s been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She’s failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on ISIS – in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world. She failed upstate New York – promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left. All she did was name a post office and a highway. She failed the inner cities. She’s failed women and children. The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors. Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we’re taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want. I’m not owned or controlled by anyone – my loyalty is to you, and no one else. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU. My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs. We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child – including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America. We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job. The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Follow the Money. Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We’re trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives. They’re all part of the same rigged political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th. Government will start working for you again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines. That’s what I want to do for our country – I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people. Together, we can accomplish anything we want. But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th – and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is already underway. You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help. You have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true. You have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation. Don’t let it slip away. Don’t let this chance go. Stand up and be heard – for your family, for your city, for your country. The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before. Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017: I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

Shimon Peres’ life always pointed toward peace.

He was a consummate statesman, a distinguished patriot and a friend of peace-loving people everywhere.

Trump met privately today with Prime Minister Netanyahu for over an hour at Mr. Trump's residence in Trump Tower. The two have known each other for many years and had the opportunity to discuss many topics important to both countries. Mr. Trump and the Prime Minister discussed the special relationship between America and Israel and the unbreakable bond between the two countries. The topics of military assistance, security and regional stability were addressed. Mr. Trump agreed that the military assistance provided to Israel and missile defense cooperation with Israel are an excellent investment for America. Mr. Trump said that under a Trump administration, there will be extraordinary strategic, technological, military and intelligence cooperation between the two countries. Mr. Trump recognized Israel as a vital partner of the United States in the global war against radical Islamic terrorism. They discussed at length the nuclear deal with Iran, the battle against ISIS and many other regional security concerns. Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu discussed at length Israel's successful experience with a security fence that helped secure its borders. They discussed Israel’s burgeoning hi-tech and biotech economy and how it has made stunning advances improving and saving lives around the world. In particular, Mr. Trump noted Israel’s emergence as a world leader in cyber defense and security and its cooperation with the United States in this regard. Mr. Trump recognized that Israel and its citizens have suffered far too long on the front lines of Islamic terrorism. He agreed with Prime Minister Netanyahu that the Israeli people want a just and lasting peace with their neighbors, but that peace will only come when the Palestinians renounce hatred and violence and accept Israel as a Jewish State. Finally, Mr. Trump acknowledged that Jerusalem has been the eternal capital of the Jewish People for over 3000 years, and that the United States, under a Trump administration, will finally accept the long-standing Congressional mandate to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of the State of Israel. The meeting concluded with both leaders promising the highest level of mutual support and cooperation should Mr. Trump have the honor and privilege of being elected President of the United States.", 'Thank you!

Today, I’m going to outline a plan for American economic revival – it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country. My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams. Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It’s a silent nation of jobless Americans. Look no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM – today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico. It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn’t drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can’t drink the water in Flint. We are going to turn this around. My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before. We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that’s left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources. Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success. Jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities. All of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism – which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country – and replace it with a new policy of Americanism. Under this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans? If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash. America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries. Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world’s great magnet for innovation and job creation. My opponent’s plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution – a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity. The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton’s scheme are the donors and the special interests. In Hillary Clinton’s America, we have surrendered our status as the world’s great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries. Not one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they’re going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed. In the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I’ve met the most amazing people. Every day, I’ve seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances. In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I’ve visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries. Politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there. Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable – how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption? The hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos – but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future. These are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don’t have a voice. I am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country. Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it’s their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration. I’m not running to be President of the world. I’m running to be President of the United States – and as your President, I will fight for every last American job. We are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon. It’s time to start thinking big once again. That’s why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth. In working with my economic team, we’ve put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math. This growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings. It will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit. It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies. Right now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter – that translates to millions of lost jobs. This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression. Over the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs. Perhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty. On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it’s first $10 trillion dollars in debt – it took President  Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion. Now, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure. Instead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce. Never has so much money been spent so poorly. But we’re going to turn that all around. Here’s how. It begins with bold new tax reform. As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all – in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely. By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs. In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit – it won’t even be close. This is a working and middle class tax relief proposal. The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka. These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan. Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation. Parents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit – in the form a Childcare rebate – and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts. A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill. By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all. One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate – down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch. We will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment. On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it’s $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country. We will turn America into a magnet for new jobs – and that means jobs in our poorest communities. Next, comes regulations. One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy. Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry – and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to. In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars. I’ve proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books. This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA’s so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills. We’re going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work. Energy reform is central to our plan as well According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama’s energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person. Hillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars. A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will: increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually add over 500,000 new jobs annually increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years. In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process. Finally, comes trade – the foundation for everything America’s annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year – an enormous drag on growth. Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent. Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country. It is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent’s campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they’ve promoted – every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality. Our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000. I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps: I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators – and I know who you are, many of you are in the room. We are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country.  We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed. We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Next, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States. I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules. If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists. Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America’s intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year. We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country. Here is how the plan adds up. We are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan. Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost. That leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade – again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements. If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs. This is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country. This is what our new future will look like.  I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I’m going to unleash American energy; I’m going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I’m going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I’m going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I’m going to save your 2nd amendment; I’m going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I’m going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA – and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first. And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds. American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job. We will put new American metal into the spine of this country. Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores. We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. And Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, and God Bless!", "We had a MASSIVE RALLY in Canton, Ohio tonight - with AMAZING AMERICAN'S.
